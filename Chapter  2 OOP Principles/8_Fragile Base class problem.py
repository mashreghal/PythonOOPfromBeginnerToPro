"""The fragile base class problem occurs when changes to a base class inadvertently break the functionality of derived classes that depend on it. 
This can happen when the base class is modified in a way that is not compatible with the expectations of the derived classes, leading to runtime errors or unexpected behavior.
For example, if a base class method is changed to require additional parameters, any derived class that overrides that method without accounting for the new parameters may fail to function correctly.
To mitigate the fragile base class problem, developers can use techniques such as composition over inheritance, where instead of inheriting from a base class, a class contains an instance of another class to achieve the desired functionality.
This reduces the dependency on the base class and makes the code more resilient to changes.
