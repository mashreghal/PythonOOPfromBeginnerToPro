"""abstraction in OOP refers to the concept of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors an object should have,

"""If the methods are protected by being prefixed with an underscore, it communicates to users of the class that these methods are intended for internal use only and should not be accessed directly from outside the class.
The python developer using EmailService class should only interact with the public send_email method, while the internal workings of connecting, authenticating, and disconnecting are hidden from them."""

"""Importantly, by using encapsulation, if any of those protected methods need to change in the future (for example, changing the authentication mechanism), the public interface remains the same. 
This means that users of the EmailService class do not need to worry about those internal changes, as long as the public method send_email continues to function as expected.

From chat gpt:
What‚Äôs Actually Going On

Inside the class:

_connect, _authenticate, _disconnect are implementation details.

The leading underscore _ is a Python convention (not a strict rule) indicating:

‚ÄúThis method is intended for internal use; don‚Äôt call it from outside.‚Äù

So, abstraction here:

Simplifies the interface.

Hides the inner workings.

Ensures consistent behavior through a controlled entry point.

üß† In Other Words

Abstraction separates:

‚ÄúWhat the object does‚Äù ‚Üí send_email()

‚ÄúHow it does it‚Äù ‚Üí _connect(), _authenticate(), _disconnect()

That‚Äôs why you can use the class without understanding or touching the lower-level logic.
