""" The solid principles are a set of five design principles that help developers create maintainable, flexible, and scalable software.
They were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) and are widely used in object-oriented programming and software engineering.
The five solid principles are:
1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility or job.
2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes must be substitutable for
their base types without altering the correctness of the program. In other words, objects of a derived class should be able to replace objects of the base class without affecting the behavior of the program.
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This means that it's better to have many small, specific interfaces rather than a few large, general ones.
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level
modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
By following these principles, developers can create software that is easier to understand, maintain, and extend over time."""
